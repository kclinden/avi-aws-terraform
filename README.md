# Avi AWS Terraform
This Terraform configuration can be used to configure all of the IAM policies and roles for AVI on AWS. Note that currently the ARNs are configured for aws-us-gov and this would need to be updated back to commercial for Standard AWS. The files can be found on the Avi Networks Github DevOps repo.
